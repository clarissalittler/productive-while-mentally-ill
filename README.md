# productive-while-mentally-ill
Repo for a short book on dealing with chronic mental illness while still trying to Get Things Done.

The idea is for this text to include a combination of my
  + personal experiences
  + techniques for staying organized
  + my own failures

That last part might sound odd, but I think it's useful to actually talk about what *doesn't* work.
